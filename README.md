- **Edit History:** View and manage the edit history of articles to ensure data transparency and reliability.

## Requirement Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Article Search:** Users can search for topics by entering keywords.
- **Browse Categories:** Users can access different article categories for easier navigation through the service.
- **Article Editing:** Users can edit existing articles, with an edit history kept for transparency.
- **Edit History:** Ability to view previous versions of articles and undo changes if needed.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Performance:** The system should be responsive, providing instant access to searched content.

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to articles, including:

- **Articles:** Stores information about content, category, and edit history.
- **Edit History:** Data on previous versions of articles, including who made the changes and when.

### Architecture Diagram:

The system architecture is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach:

- **Model:** Handles data storage logic and processing.
- **View:** Presents encyclopedic content to users.
- **Controller:** Manages user interactions, such as searching and editing articles.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) for user interface.
- **Backend:** Django (Python) as the framework managing server logic.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing articles, users, and edit history.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for views, editing logic, and database management.
- _Coding Style:_ Using modular patterns, readable code, and detailed comments.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of searching, article editing, and other basic functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify the cooperation of frontend and backend components.
- **User Interface Tests:** Testing user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Assess the speed of the application, especially when searching and browsing articles.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test cases for each function of the application.
- Report and document bugs, along with procedures for fixing them.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Beta testing, bug fixes, and publishing on user-accessible platforms.
- **Deadlines:** Setting deadlines for each stage of development.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Create a contact channel for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Regular updates based on user feedback and emerging needs.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Execution Phases:** Divide the project into phases, such as implementing the search function, creating article pages, and testing.
- **Deadlines:** Estimated time for each phase.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Cost based on the number of hours worked by the development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Costs for servers, databases, updates, and technical support for users.
