## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Q&A Section" project aims to provide users with an interactive module that can be integrated into a website to answer frequently asked questions. The module allows for automatic responses, enabling users to quickly access information without the need for direct contact with customer support.

### Feature Description:

- **Question and Answer Database:** Stores frequently asked questions and answers, allowing easy access to information.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search the question database to find the information they need.
- **Personalized Responses:** Responses can be tailored to meet the specific needs of users with dynamic content.
- **Question Analysis:** The module analyzes new questions submitted by users and suggests adding them to the database to keep the system updated and improved.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Q&A Database:** The system should allow the administrator to add, edit, and delete questions and answers.
- **Search Functionality:** Users should be able to search available questions using keywords.
- **Personalized Responses:** The content of responses can be customized depending on the user’s context.
- **New Question Submission:** Users can submit new questions that are not yet in the database.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Responsiveness:** The module must work correctly on both mobile devices and desktop.
- **Performance:** Responses should be delivered instantly to meet user expectations.
- **Integration:** The module should be easy to integrate into an existing website, with the ability to adapt the style to match the website design.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Q&A Homepage:_ A view of frequently asked questions, with a visible search field.
- _Search Window:_ Users can type their question, and the system will automatically suggest answers.
- _Submit a Question Window:_ A form for users to submit new questions that will be processed by the administrator.

### Site Map:

- _Q&A Homepage_
  - List of frequently asked questions
  - Search field
- _Submit a Question Window_
  - Submission form for users
  - Overview of submitted questions (for the administrator)

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data about questions and answers, including:

- **Questions and Answers:** Contains the text of questions and their corresponding answers, with information about the date of addition and popularity.
- **Submitted Questions:** New questions submitted by users waiting for approval by the administrator.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure:

- **Model:** Manages the question and answer data.
- **View:** Presents the Q&A section interface to the user.
- **Controller:** Handles user queries and manages searches within the database.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) - for an interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) - to handle queries and process submissions.
- **Database:** MongoDB - to store questions, answers, and user submissions.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate modules for frontend, backend, and data management logic.
- _Code Writing Style:_ Use of modularity and code reusability with appropriate comments.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of search functions and adding new entries to the database.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the frontend communicates correctly with the backend.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check the responsiveness of the interface and ease of navigation.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate response speed to user queries.

### Testing Procedures:

- Prepare test cases for each application function.
- Conduct tests on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing on a staging server, deployment to production, monitoring the module’s performance.
- **Timeline:** Specify dates for testing and full deployment to end-users.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Provide an email address or contact form for reporting issues with the module.
- **Updates:** Regularly add new questions and answers based on user needs and analysis of submitted questions.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Costs for frontend and backend developers, estimated based on hours of work.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Hosting, technical support, and future updates and additions to the database.
